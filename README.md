# dotfiles
My custom dotfiles that I use on my machine(s).

## dependencies
These dotfiles were made on an EndeavourOS (No Desktop) system with HyprLand manually installed. This repo is designed for me, and only me, to plug-n-play. There are configs specific to me, such as gitattributes. Feel free to copy configs, but be warned that *here be dragons*.

- hypridle: auto-lock desktop when idle
- hyprland: window manager
- hyprlock: lock screen
- hyprpaper: wallpaper utility
- hyprshot: screenshot utility
- kitty: terminal emulator
- nemo: file manager
- swaync: desktop notifications
- waybar: top bar
- wofi: application launcher
- yin-yang: change gtk light/dark theme automatically
