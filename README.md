# dotfiles
My custom dotfiles that I use on my machine(s).

## dependencies
These dotfiles were made on an EndeavourOS (No Desktop) with HyprLand manually installed. This is designed for me to plug-n-play, no one else. Configs specific to me, such as my gitconfig, are in here. Here be dragons.

- hypridle: auto-lock desktop when idle
- hyprland: window manager
- hyprlock: lock screen
- hyprpaper: wallpaper utility
- hyprshot: screenshot utility
- kitty: terminal emulator
- nemo: file manager
- swaync: desktop notifications
- waybar: top bar
- wofi: application launcher
- yin-yang: change gtk light/dark theme automatically
